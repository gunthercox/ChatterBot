  "description": "The ChatterBot core subsystem is designed around a central `ChatterBot` orchestrator that manages the conversational flow. User input is encapsulated within a `Statement` object, which then undergoes a series of transformations by `Preprocessors` to clean and normalize the text. The `ChatterBot` then leverages various `Logic Adapters` to determine the most appropriate response, often utilizing `Parsing Utilities` for advanced text interpretation. The final response is also represented as a `Statement` object, completing the conversational turn. This modular design allows for flexible extension and customization of input processing, response generation, and data handling.",
