Changes from 0.4.9 to 3.78 (Sep 6, 1999):

    Lots of new tests.  Renamed to follow the GNU make scheme.  Also
    added some support for using Purify with make.

    Rob Tulloh contributed some changes to get the test suite running on
    NT; I tweaked them a bit (hopefully I didn't break anything!)  Note
    that NT doesn't grok the self-exec funkiness that Unix shells use,
    so instead I broke that out into a separate shell script
    "run_make_tests" that invokes perl with the (renamed) script
    run_make_tests.pl.

    Eli Zaretski contributed changes to get the test suite running on
    DOS with DJGPP.  I also meddled in these somewhat.

    If you're on DOS or NT you should run "perl.exe run_make_tests.pl ..."
    If you're on Unix, you can continue to run "./run_make_tests ..." as
    before.

Changes from 0.4.8 to 0.4.9 (May 14, 1998):

    Release by Paul D. Smith <psmith@baynetworks.com>; I'm the one to
    blame for problems in this version :).

    Add some perl to test_driver.pl to strip out GNU make clock skew
    warning messages from the output before comparing it to the
    known-good output.

    A new test for escaped :'s in filenames (someone on VMS found this
    didn't work anymore in 3.77): scripts/features/escape.

Changes from 0.4.7 to 0.4.8 (May 14, 1998):

    Release by Paul D. Smith <psmith@baynetworks.com>; I'm the one to
    blame for problems in this version :).

    New tests for features to be included in GNU make 3.77.

Changes from 0.4.6 to 0.4.7 (August 18, 1997):

    Release by Paul D. Smith <psmith@baynetworks.com>; I'm the one to
    blame for problems in this version :).

    Reworked some tests to make sure they all work with both perl4 and perl5.

    Work around a bug in perl 5.004 which doesn't clean the environment
    correctly in all cases (fixed in at least 5.004_02).

    Updated functions/strip to test for newline stripping.

    Keep a $PURIFYOPTIONS env variable if present.

Changes from 0.4.5 to 0.4.6 (April 07, 1997):

    Release by Paul D. Smith <psmith@baynetworks.com>; I'm the one to
    blame for problems in this version :).

    Updated to work with GNU make 3.76 (and pretests).

    Added new tests and updated existing ones.  Note that the new tests
    weren't tested with perl 4, however I think they should work.

    Ignore any tests whose filenames end in "~", so that Emacs backup
    files aren't run.

Changes from 0.4.4 to 0.4.5 (April 29, 1995):

    Updated to be compatible with perl 5.001 as well as 4.036.

    Note: the test suite still won't work on 14-char filesystems
    (sorry, Kaveh), but I will get to it.

    Also, some tests and stuff still haven't made it in because I
    haven't had time to write the test scripts for them.  But they,
    too, will get in eventually.  Contributions of scripts (ie, tests
    that I can just drop in) are particularly welcome and will be
    incorporated immediately.

Changes from 0.4.3 to 0.4.4 (March 1995):

    Updated for changes in make 3.72.12, and to ignore CVS directories
    (thanks go to Jim Meyering for the patches for this).

    Fixed uname call to not make a mess on BSD/OS 2.0 (whose uname -a
    is very verbose).  Let me know if this doesn't work correctly on
    your system.

    Changed to display test name while it is running, not just when it
    finishes.

    Note: the test suite still won't work on 14-char filesystems
    (sorry, Kaveh), but I will get to it.

    Also, some tests and stuff still haven't made it in because I
    haven't had time to write the test scripts for them.  But they,
    too, will get in eventually.

Changes from 0.4 to 0.4.3 (October 1994):

    Fixed bugs (like dependencies on environment variables).

    Caught up with changes in make.

    The load_limit test should now silently ignore a failure due to
    make not being able to read /dev/kmem.

    Reorganized tests into subdirs and renamed lots of things so that
    those poor souls who still have to deal with 14-char filename
    limits won't hate me any more.  Thanks very much to Kaveh R. Ghazi
    <ghazi@noc.rutgers.edu> for helping me with the implementation and
    testing of these changes, and for putting up with all my whining
    about it...

    Added a $| = 1 so that systems that don't seem to automatically
    flush their output for some reason will still print all the
    output.  I'd hate for someone to miss out on the smiley that
    you're supposed to get when all the tests pass... :-)

Changes from 0.3 to 0.4 (August 1993):

    Lost in the mists of time (and my hurry to get it out before I
    left my job).

Changes from 0.2 to 0.3 (9-30-92):

    Several tests fixed to match the fact that MAKELEVEL > 0 or -C now
    imply -w.

    parallel_execution test fixed to not use double colon rules any
    more since their behavior has changed.

    errors_in_commands test fixed to handle different error messages
    and return codes from rm.

    Several tests fixed to handle -make_path with a relative path
    and/or a name other than "make" for make.

    dash-e-option test fixed to use $PATH instead of $USER (since the
    latter does not exist on some System V systems).  This also
    removes the dependency on getlogin (which fails under certain
    weird conditions).

    test_driver_core changed so that you can give a test name like
    scripts/errors_in_commands and it will be handled correctly (handy
    if you have a shell with filename completion).

Changes from 0.1 to 0.2 (5-4-92):

    README corrected to require perl 4.019, not 4.010.

    -make_path replaces -old.

    errors_in_commands test updated for change in format introduced in
    make 3.62.6.

    test_driver_core now uses a better way of figuring what OS it is
    running on (thanks to meyering@cs.utexas.edu (Jim Meyering) for
    suggesting this, as well as discovering the hard way that the old
    way (testing for /mnt) fails on his machine).

    Some new tests were added.
