rules.  The first rule has a series of sleep and echo commands
intended to run in series.  The second and third have just an
echo statement.  When make is called in this test, it is given
the -j option with a value of 4.  This tells make that it may
start up to four jobs simultaneously.  In this case, since the
first command is a sleep command, the output of the second
and third commands will appear before the first if indeed
make is running all of these commands in parallel.";
