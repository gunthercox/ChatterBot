# 2.1.6

* Resolves an issue where postcss-svgo would convert colours to hex codes
  without URL-encoding the `#`.

* Bump svgo to v0.7.x.

# 2.1.4

* Fixes an issue where postcss-svgo would throw with some SVGs that were
  not properly URI encoded.

# 2.1.3

* Upgrade is-svg to version 2.

  SVG source, breaking IE compatibility (thanks to @ophyros).
