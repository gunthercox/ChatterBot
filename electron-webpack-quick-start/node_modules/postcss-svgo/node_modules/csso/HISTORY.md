    - Dynamic scanner implemented
    - New AST format + dynamic scanner = performance boost and less memory consumption

## 1.8.1 (March 30, 2016)

- Don't remove spaces after function/braces/urls since unsafe (#289)

## 1.8.0 (March 24, 2016)

    - Filter rulesets by tag names, class names and ids white lists.
    - More aggressive ruleset moving using class name scopes information.
    - New CLI option `--usage` to pass usage data file.

    - Difference in pseudo signature just prevents ruleset merging, but don't stop lookup.
    - Simplify block comparison (performance).
- New method `csso.minifyBlock()` for css block compression (e.g. `style` attribute content).
- Ruleset merge improvement: at-rules with block (like `@media` or `@supports`) now can be skipped during ruleset merge lookup if doesn't contain something prevents it.
- FIX: Add negation (`:not()`) to pseudo signature to avoid unsafe merge (old browsers doesn't support it).
- FIX: Check nested parts of value when compute compatibility. It fixes unsafe property merging.
