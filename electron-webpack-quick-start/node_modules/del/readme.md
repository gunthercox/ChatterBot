# del [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/del.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/del) [![XO code style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-XO-5ed9c7.svg)](https://github.com/xojs/xo)

> Delete files and folders using [globs](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch#usage)

Similar to [rimraf](https://github.com/isaacs/rimraf), but with a Promise API and support for multiple files and globbing. It also protects you against deleting the current working directory and above.

## Install

```
$ npm install del
```


## Usage

```js
const del = require('del');

(async () => {
	const deletedPaths = await del(['tmp/*.js', '!tmp/unicorn.js']);

	console.log('Deleted files and folders:\n', deletedPaths.join('\n'));
})();
```


## Beware

The glob pattern `**` matches all children and *the parent*.

So this won't work:

```js
del.sync(['public/assets/**', '!public/assets/goat.png']);
```

You have to explicitly ignore the parent directories too:

```js
del.sync(['public/assets/**', '!public/assets', '!public/assets/goat.png']);
```

Suggestions on how to improve this welcome!

Returns a promise for an array of deleted paths.

### del.sync(patterns, [options])

Returns an array of deleted paths.

#### patterns

Type: `string` `string[]`

See supported minimatch [patterns](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch#usage).

- [Pattern examples with expected matches](https://github.com/sindresorhus/multimatch/blob/master/test/test.js)
