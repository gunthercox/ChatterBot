> Reduces an object to a value that is the accumulated result of running each property in the object through a callback.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --save object.reduce
```

Install with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com):

```sh
$ yarn add object.reduce
```

Install with [bower](https://bower.io/)

```sh
$ bower install object.reduce --save
```

## Usage

the initial value (or value from the previous callback call), the `value` of the current property, the `key` of the current property, and the `object` over which the function is iterating. Node.js/JavaScript utility.)_

**Params**

* `object` **{Object}**: The object to iterate over (the iteratee)
* `fn` **{Function}**: The function invoked per iteration.
* `init` **{Object}**: The initial value to use for the accumulator.
* `thisArg` **{Object}**: (optional) Object to use as the invocation context for the iterator (expose as `this` inside the iterator)

Executes the given callback `fn` once for each own enumerable property in the object. The callback receives the following arguments:

* `acc`: the initial value (or value from the previous callback call),
* `value`: the of the current property,
* `key`: the of the current property, and
* the original `object` over which the function is iterating.

**Example**

```js
var reduce = require('object.reduce');
var a = {a: 'foo', b: 'bar', c: 'baz'};

reduce(a, function(acc, value, key, obj) {
  acc[key] = value.toUpperCase();
  return acc;
}, {});

//=> {a: 'FOO', b: 'BAR', c: 'BAZ'};
```
