 *
 * Errors if Observable does not emit a value in given time span.
 *
 * <span class="informal">Timeouts on Observable that doesn't emit values fast enough.</span>
 *
 * <img src="./img/timeout.png" width="100%">
 *
 * `timeout` operator accepts as an argument either a number or a Date.
 *
 * If number was provided, it returns an Observable that behaves like a source
 * Observable, unless there is a period of time where there is no value emitted.
 * So if you provide `100` as argument and first value comes after 50ms from
 * the moment of subscription, this value will be simply re-emitted by the resulting
 * Observable. If however after that 100ms passes without a second value being emitted,
 * stream will end with an error and source Observable will be unsubscribed.
 * These checks are performed throughout whole lifecycle of Observable - from the moment
 * it was subscribed to, until it completes or errors itself. Thus every value must be
 * emitted within specified period since previous value.
 *
 * If provided argument was Date, returned Observable behaves differently. It throws
 * if Observable did not complete before provided Date. This means that periods between
 * emission of particular values do not matter in this case. If Observable did not complete
 * before provided Date, source Observable will be unsubscribed. Other than that, resulting
 * stream behaves just as source Observable.
 *
 * `timeout` accepts also a Scheduler as a second parameter. It is used to schedule moment (or moments)
 * when returned Observable will check if source stream emitted value or completed.
 *
 * @example <caption>Check if ticks are emitted within certain timespan</caption>
 * const seconds = Rx.Observable.interval(1000);
 *
 * seconds.timeout(1100) // Let's use bigger timespan to be safe,
 *                       // since `interval` might fire a bit later then scheduled.
 * .subscribe(
 *     value => console.log(value), // Will emit numbers just as regular `interval` would.
 *     err => console.log(err) // Will never be called.
 * );
 *
 * seconds.timeout(900).subscribe(
 *     value => console.log(value), // Will never be called.
 *     err => console.log(err) // Will emit error before even first value is emitted,
 *                             // since it did not arrive within 900ms period.
 * );
 *
 * @example <caption>Use Date to check if Observable completed</caption>
 * const seconds = Rx.Observable.interval(1000);
 *
 * seconds.timeout(new Date("December 17, 2020 03:24:00"))
 * .subscribe(
 *     value => console.log(value), // Will emit values as regular `interval` would
 *                                  // until December 17, 2020 at 03:24:00.
 *     err => console.log(err) // On December 17, 2020 at 03:24:00 it will emit an error,
 *                             // since Observable did not complete by then.
 * );
