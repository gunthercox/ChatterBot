/**
 * Converts a higher-order Observable into a first-order Observable which
 * concurrently delivers all values that are emitted on the inner Observables.
 *
 * <span class="informal">Flattens an Observable-of-Observables.</span>
 *
 * <img src="./img/mergeAll.png" width="100%">
 *
 * `mergeAll` subscribes to an Observable that emits Observables, also known as
 * a higher-order Observable. Each time it observes one of these emitted inner
 * Observables, it subscribes to that and delivers all the values from the
 * inner Observable on the output Observable. The output Observable only
 * completes once all inner Observables have completed. Any error delivered by
 * a inner Observable will be immediately emitted on the output Observable.
 *
 * @example <caption>Spawn a new interval Observable for each click event, and blend their outputs as one Observable</caption>
 * var clicks = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(document, 'click');
 * var higherOrder = clicks.map((ev) => Rx.Observable.interval(1000));
 * var firstOrder = higherOrder.mergeAll();
 * firstOrder.subscribe(x => console.log(x));
 *
 * @example <caption>Count from 0 to 9 every second for each click, but only allow 2 concurrent timers</caption>
 * var clicks = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(document, 'click');
 * var higherOrder = clicks.map((ev) => Rx.Observable.interval(1000).take(10));
 * var firstOrder = higherOrder.mergeAll(2);
 * firstOrder.subscribe(x => console.log(x));
