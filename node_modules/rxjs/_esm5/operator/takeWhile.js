 * Emits values emitted by the source Observable so long as each value satisfies
 * the given `predicate`, and then completes as soon as this `predicate` is not
 * satisfied.

 * <span class="informal">Takes values from the source only while they pass the
 * condition given. When the first value does not satisfy, it completes.</span>

 *
 * `takeWhile` subscribes and begins mirroring the source Observable. Each value
 * emitted on the source is given to the `predicate` function which returns a
 * boolean, representing a condition to be satisfied by the source values. The
 * output Observable emits the source values until such time as the `predicate`
 * returns false, at which point `takeWhile` stops mirroring the source
 * Observable and completes the output Observable.
 *
 * @example <caption>Emit click events only while the clientX property is greater than 200</caption>
 * var clicks = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(document, 'click');
 * var result = clicks.takeWhile(ev => ev.clientX > 200);
 * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x));

 *
 * @param {function(value: T, index: number): boolean} predicate A function that
 * evaluates a value emitted by the source Observable and returns a boolean.
 * Also takes the (zero-based) index as the second argument.
 * @return {Observable<T>} An Observable that emits the values from the source
 * Observable so long as each value satisfies the condition defined by the
 * `predicate`, then completes.
