/**
 * Emits a value from the source Observable only after a particular time span
 * has passed without another source emission.
 *
 * <span class="informal">It's like {@link delay}, but passes only the most
 * recent value from each burst of emissions.</span>
 *
 * <img src="./img/debounceTime.png" width="100%">
 *
 * `debounceTime` delays values emitted by the source Observable, but drops
 * previous pending delayed emissions if a new value arrives on the source
 * Observable. This operator keeps track of the most recent value from the
 * source Observable, and emits that only when `dueTime` enough time has passed
 * without any other value appearing on the source Observable. If a new value
 * appears before `dueTime` silence occurs, the previous value will be dropped
 * and will not be emitted on the output Observable.
 *
 * This is a rate-limiting operator, because it is impossible for more than one
 * value to be emitted in any time window of duration `dueTime`, but it is also
 * a delay-like operator since output emissions do not occur at the same time as
 * they did on the source Observable. Optionally takes a {@link IScheduler} for
 * managing timers.
 *
 * @example <caption>Emit the most recent click after a burst of clicks</caption>
 * var clicks = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(document, 'click');
 * var result = clicks.debounceTime(1000);
 * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x));
 *
 * @see {@link auditTime}
 * @see {@link debounce}
 * @see {@link delay}
 * @see {@link sampleTime}
 * @see {@link throttleTime}
 *
 * @param {number} dueTime The timeout duration in milliseconds (or the time
 * unit determined internally by the optional `scheduler`) for the window of
 * time required to wait for emission silence before emitting the most recent
 * source value.
 * @param {Scheduler} [scheduler=async] The {@link IScheduler} to use for
 * managing the timers that handle the timeout for each value.
 * @return {Observable} An Observable that delays the emissions of the source
 * Observable by the specified `dueTime`, and may drop some values if they occur
 * too frequently.
 * @method debounceTime
 * @owner Observable
