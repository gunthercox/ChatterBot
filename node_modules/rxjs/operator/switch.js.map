Each time it observes one of these emitted inner\n * Observables, the output Observable subscribes to the inner Observable and\n * begins emitting the items emitted by that. So far, it behaves\n * like {@link mergeAll}. However, when a new inner Observable is emitted,\n * `switch` unsubscribes from the earlier-emitted inner Observable and\n * subscribes to the new inner Observable and begins emitting items from it. It\n * continues to behave like this for subsequent inner Observables.\n *\n * @example <caption>Rerun an interval Observable on every click event</caption>\n * var clicks = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(document, 'click');\n * // Each click event is mapped to an Observable that ticks every second\n * var higherOrder = clicks.map((ev) => Rx.Observable.interval(1000));\n * var switched = higherOrder.switch();\n * // The outcome is that `switched` is essentially a timer that restarts\n * // on every click. The interval Observables from older clicks do not merge\n * // with the current interval Observable.\n * switched.subscribe(x => console.log(x));\n *\n * @see {@link combineAll}\n * @see {@link concatAll}\n * @see {@link exhaust}\n * @see {@link mergeAll}\n * @see {@link switchMap}\n * @see {@link switchMapTo}\n * @see {@link zipAll}\n *\n * @return {Observable<T>} An Observable that emits the items emitted by the\n * Observable most recently emitted by the source Observable.\n * @method switch\n * @name switch\n * @owner Observable\n */\nexport function _switch<T>(this: Observable<Observable<T>>): Observable<T> {\n  return higherOrder()(this) as Observable<T>;\n}\n"]}
