"Consider if playing Xbox would be a wiser choice before proceeding..."
"Think of it this way, is it worth the jail time?"
"In the end, I can't figure out how to use Autosploit in a way that isn't merely a random act of vandalism.."
"Threat or menace? 'Autosploit' tool sparks fears of empowered 'script kiddies'"
"So far the response to AutoSploit has been a mix of outrage, fear, some applause, and more than a few shrugs."
"Releasing AutoSploit, making mass exploitation even easier, was irresponsible. My friends at the FBI remind us all that while exploitation is easier, it is not any less illegal. #scriptkiddiesbeware"
"New tool makes hacking even easier. Many people are critical of the release."
"The kids are not more dangerous. They already were dangerous. We’ve simply given them a newer, simpler, shinier way to exploit everything that’s broken. Maybe we should fix the ROOT problem"
"This provides an unending opportunity for cybercriminals and script kiddies to hijack vulnerable devices and subsequently launch attacks against online organizations with ease"
"Both Metasploit and Shodan have been available for years, as integral to the pen testers toolkit as Nessus and Burpsuite. But with Autosploit pulling them together, the concern should be focused on curious kids thinking it would be fun to see what they can find"
"My fear is that this has magnified the attack surface, and made it so that every exposed service on the internet will be scanned and probed on a near-constant basis by an entirely new set of attackers."
"The release of tools like these exponentially expands the threat landscape by allowing a wider group of hackers to launch global attacks at will"
"Good to know we’ve weaponized for the masses. Everyone can now be a script kiddie simply by plugging, playing and attacking."
"The fact that something is really easy, does not make unauthorized computer access any less a crime. And tools like this leave a forensic footprint that is miles wide. Yes, you can compromise poorly protected systems very easily with this tool, but you can also end up in a lot of trouble."
"I can't believe it's not skidware!"
