Usage of AutoSploit for attacking targets without prior mutual consent is illegal in pretty much every sense of the word. It is the
end user's responsibility to obey all applicable local, state, and federal laws. Developers assume no liability and are not responsible
for any misuse or damage caused by this program or any component thereof. 

Developers do not encourage nor condone any illegal activity;

In OffSec/RedTeam engagements it is important however to mind your operational security. With that in mind, please consider the following:

 - Use AutoSploit on a VPS through a proxy(chain) or Tor
 - Keep calm and wipe/data-poison the logs or use tools to do so
 - Never connect from your local IP address
 - Keep a low profile, AutoSploit is loud


In closing, knowledge is not illegal and anybody that tells you learning is wrong is a fool.
Get as much out of this program as we got from writing it. Remember though, common sense and a sense of ethics go a long way.

Thank you.
