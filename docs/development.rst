Development
===========

As the code for ChatterBot is written, the developers attempt to describe
the logic and reasoning for the various decisions that go into creating the
internal structure of the software. This internal documentation is intended
for future developers and maintainers of the project. A majority of this
information is unnecessary for the typical developer using ChatterBot.

It is not always possible for every idea to be documented. As a result, the
need may arise to question the developers and maintainers of this project
in order to pull concepts from their minds and place them in these documents.
Please pull gently.
