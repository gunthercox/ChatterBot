=====================
The MultiLogicAdapter
=====================

ChatterBot internally uses a special logic adapter that allows it to choose the
best response generated by any number of other logic adapters.

Selecting a response from multiple logic adapters
=================================================

The :code:`MultiLogicAdapter` is used to select a single response from the responses
returned by all of the logic adapters that the chat bot has been configured to use.
Each response returned by the logic adapters includes a confidence score that indicates
the likeliness that the returned statement is a valid response to the input.

Response selection
------------------

The :code:`MultiLogicAdapter` will return the response statement that has the greatest
confidence score. The only exception to this is a case where multiple logic adapters
return the same statement and therefore *agree* on that response.

For this example, consider a scenario where multiple logic adapters are being used.
Assume the following results were returned by a chat bot's logic adapters.

+------------+--------------+
| Confidence | Statement    |
+============+==============+
| 0.2        | Good morning |
+------------+--------------+
| 0.5        | Good morning |
+------------+--------------+
| 0.7        | Good night   |
+------------+--------------+

In this case, two of the logic adapters have generated the same result.
When multiple logic adapters come to the same conclusion, that statement
is given priority over another response with a possibly higher confidence score.
The fact that the multiple adapters agreed on a response is a significant
indicator that a particular statement has a greater probability of being
a more accurate response to the input.

When multiple adapters agree on a response, the greatest confidence score that
was generated for that response will be returned with it.
