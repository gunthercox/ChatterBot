=====================
The MultiLogicAdapter
=====================

ChatterBot internally uses a special logic adapter that allows it to choose the
best response generated by any number of other logic adapters.

Selecting a response from multiple logic adapters
=================================================

The :code:`MultiLogicAdapter` is used to select a single response from the responses
returned by all of the logic adapters that the chat bot has been configured to use.
Each response returned by the logic adapters includes a confidence score that indicates
the likeliness that the returned statement is a valid response to the input.

Response selection
------------------

The :code:`MultiLogicAdapter` will return the response statement that has the greatest
confidence score. The only exception to this is a case where multiple logic adapters
return the same statement and therefore *agree* on that response.

For this example, consider a scenario where multiple logic adapters are being used.
Assume the following results were returned by a chat bot's logic adapters.

+------------+--------------+
| Confidence | Statement    |
+============+==============+
| 0.2        | Good morning |
+------------+--------------+
| 0.5        | Good morning |
+------------+--------------+
| 0.7        | Good night   |
+------------+--------------+

In this case, two of the logic adapters have generated the same result.
When multiple logic adapters come to to the same conclusion, that statement
is given priority over another response with a possibly higher confidence score.
The fact that the multiple adapters agreed on a response is a significant
indicator that a particular statement has a greater probability of being
a more accurate response to the input.

When multiple adapters agree on a response, the greatest confidence score that
was generated for that response will be returned with it.
