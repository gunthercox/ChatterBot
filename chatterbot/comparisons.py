    Calculate the similarity of two statements using Spacy models.

    NOTE:
        You will also need to download a ``spacy`` model to use for tagging. Internally these are used to determine parts of speech for words.

        The easiest way to do this is to use the ``spacy download`` command directly:

        .. code-block:: python

           python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
           python -m spacy download de_core_news_sm

        Alternatively, the ``spacy`` models can be installed as Python packages. The following lines could be included in a ``requirements.txt`` or ``pyproject.yml`` file if you needed to pin specific versions:

        .. code-block:: text

class JaccardSimilarity(Comparator):
    """
    Calculates the similarity of two statements based on the Jaccard index.

    The Jaccard index is composed of a numerator and denominator.
    In the numerator, we count the number of items that are shared between the sets.
    In the denominator, we count the total number of items across both sets.
    Let's say we define sentences to be equivalent if 50% or more of their tokens are equivalent.
    Here are two sample sentences:

        The young cat is hungry.
        The cat is very hungry.

    When we parse these sentences to remove stopwords, we end up with the following two sets:

        {young, cat, hungry}
        {cat, very, hungry}

    In our example above, our intersection is {cat, hungry}, which has count of two.
    The union of the sets is {young, cat, very, hungry}, which has a count of four.
    Therefore, our `Jaccard similarity index`_ is two divided by four, or 50%.
    Given our similarity threshold above, we would consider this to be a match.
